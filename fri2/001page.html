        <div class="text fingerprint"> In ancient China, there was no ID card, but there were two types of documents similar to ID cards, namely, talisman and letter of credit. In contrast, the talisman focused on identification and the letter of transmittal focused on access. On the functional level, it seems that the equation of "talisman + letter of transmittal = ID card" can be derived, but from the connotation and origin, talisman, letter of transmittal and ID card are only similar in form, but very different in essence, but this is the earliest item about personal identification.</div>
